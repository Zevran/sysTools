sysTools
========

sysTools :: simple and usefull for lazy developpers

ToDo :
 - git custom commands : making it easier to manage repositories and access
 - backup commands : combined with cron tab
 - auto-scripts for adapted configuration server : web, cloud, dev.

 More will come :)

 Feel free to do some pull request or suggestions.
